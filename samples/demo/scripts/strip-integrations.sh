# Strip third-party integrations from the demo in place.
#
# Use this before publishing a sanitized copy of the demo, or wire it
# into a CI/git-hook/task that emits a downstream-ready snapshot.
# Idempotent — re-running is a no-op once stripped.
#
# What it does:
#   1. Removes every block bracketed by `third-party:begin` and
#      `third-party:end` marker lines in the target files.
#   2. Deletes files that are entirely third-party glue.
#
# Marker syntax (any line containing the literal phrases below):
#   HTML:  <!-- third-party:begin <name> -->   <!-- third-party:end <name> -->
#   CSS:   /* third-party:begin <name> */      /* third-party:end <name> */
#   TS/JS: // third-party:begin <name>         // third-party:end <name>
